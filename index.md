I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience">Department of Computer Science</a> at the College of William and Mary, being advised by <a href="http://adwaitnadkarni.com">Prof. Adwait Nadkarni</a>. My research interests lie in analyzing security policies employed in modern operating systems as well as designing security frameworks that enforces such policies. I work at the <a href="https://spl-wm.github.io/">Secure Platforms Lab (SPL)</a> at William & Mary, where currently, I am involved in identifying and analyzing security problems in smart home platforms and devices, especially concerning home automation.
