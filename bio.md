<p>
    I am originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Biratnagar+56613,+Nepal/@26.4481954,87.201767,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x39ef744704331cc5:0x6d9a85e45c54b3fc!8m2!3d26.4524746!4d87.271781">Biratnagar, Nepal</a>. I completed my B.E in Computer Engineering at Tribhuwan University, <a href="http://pcampus.edu.np/">Institue of Engineering, Pulchowk</a>. I joined the College of William &amp; Mary as a PhD student on the Fall of 2017. I have since been working at the <a href="https://spl-wm.github.io/">Secure Platforms Lab (SPL)</a> with <a href="https://adwaitnadkarni.com">Prof. Adwait Nadkarni</a> to analyze and identify current security issues in smart home platforms. My free time generally sees me enjoying an audio book or hiking.
