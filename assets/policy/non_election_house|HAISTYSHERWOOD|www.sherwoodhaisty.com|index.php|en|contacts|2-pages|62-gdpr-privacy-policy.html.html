<p>On May 25, 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will go into effect across all European Union markets. We believe this presents a new opportunity for marketers to strengthen their brand loyalty by focusing on consumer privacy while delivering amazing experiences. Think of it as experiential privacy — having privacy be a key part of the customer experience, through relevant privacy notices presented in context and choices that are on brand.
