By providing Personal Information, you consent to the transfer of your Personal Information to the United States and the use of your Personal Information, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we collect Personal Information from EU residents, we strive to do so in a manner in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR</b>”), which include acknowledgment of EU residents’ rights, including the following:</p><ul><li>to withdraw your consent to the processing of Personal Information about you to which you have previously given consent;</li><li>to object to processing of Personal Information about you for the purpose of direct marketing; and</li><li>to have incorrect Personal Information about you corrected.</li></ul><p>You also have the right to obtain a copy of the Personal Information we have about you, although we reserve the right to charge a fee for this.</p><h3><b>California Residents</b></h3><p>Some browsers have incorporated “<b>Do Not Track</b>” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to a website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. California law requires that an operator of a website or other online service disclose how the operator responds to a Do Not Track signal and whether third parties may collect personal information about an individual’s online activities from the operator’s website or online service. <b>Friends of Bernie Sanders</b> is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected through the Sites, however please be aware that the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions, and therefore the Sites may or may not respond to those signals.</p><p>California law also provides California residents with the right to receive disclosures about any sharing of their Personal Information to a business in connection with a business relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, and if that business has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such an individual’s Personal Information to a third-party and knows or should have known that such third-party used the information for its own direct marketing purposes, then that business is obligated to disclose in writing to such individual upon request, what Personal Information was shared and with whom it was shared. Any request for a disclosure required under this California law should be sent to us via email at info@berniesanders.com or via regular mail at <b>Friends of Bernie Sanders</b>, PO Box 391 Burlington, VT 05402.</p><h3><b>Updates to This Privacy Policy</b></h3><p><b>Friends of Bernie Sanders</b> may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time so we encourage you to check this page when revisiting the Sites to make sure that you are informed of how your personal information will be used. We will post notice of any changes by revising the date last updated on the Privacy Policy.
