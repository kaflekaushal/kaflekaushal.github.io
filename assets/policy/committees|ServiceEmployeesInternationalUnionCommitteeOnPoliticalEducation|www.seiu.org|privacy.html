<p>SEIU strongly believes in the importance of your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how SEIU treats the personal information we collect through the SEIU website (the "Website") and what we do with that information. By using or accessing the Website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected online through the Website and does not describe the ways in which we may collect or use information obtained offline or through any means other than our website or other entity. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.</p>
<h2>How, When, and Why We Collect Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What we collect about you when browsing our website.</strong>&nbsp;You can view content on the Website without registering or providing any personal information. When you enter the Website via a computer, tablet, application, mobile phone, or other internet portal, we use a variety of tracking tools to collect information such as your browser and operating system type and IP address to optimize your experience on the Website, comply with applicable laws, and to track aggregate Website usage. The information sent to us through the Website includes, but is not limited to, the following: data about the pages you access, computer IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device type, geo-location information, computer and connection information, mobile network information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, referral URL, ad data, and standard web log data and other information. We also collect anonymous information through our use of cookies and web beacons, and other similar technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Initiation of Contact by Us.</strong> We may use any information you provide to us to contact you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
	  <p><strong>Activity Requiring Registration.</strong> Certain activities on the Website such as joining SEIU as an associate member require you to register, which are subject to <a href="https://act.seiu.org/onlineactions/ZAVBN-97gUCSicJFumGLqw2">the terms stated here.</a> To become a registered user, we ask you to provide your name, email address, postal code, occupation and employer. If you decide to register, we use a persistent cookie that stores certain information to make it easier for you to login when you come back to the Website. However, none of your personal information is stored in that cookie. Furthermore, SEIU has no access to any payment or financial information provided through this Website. Personal financial information is maintained on a secured server hosted and/or controlled by Direct Connect, and information you provide to them is subject to <a href="http://directconnectps.com/privacy-policy/">their privacy policy which you can access here</a>. You may also be asked to provide additional information to participate in certain activities that we may undertake through the Website. In no instance will SEIU sell any personal information provided by you to this Website. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Usage Information.</strong> We may record information about your usage of the Website, such as when you use the site, the areas of the site you click on and/or participate in, the tags you search for, and whether or not you subscribe to the RSS feed. A persistent cookie may be used to track this information, but will not track financial information entered. We may use pixel tags and/or trackable links in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and/or clicked on by recipients. Furthermore, if you choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), then you must know that the information we receive varies by site and is controlled by that site. By associating an account managed by a third party with usage of the Website you are authorizing SEIU to have access to this information, and you agree that SEIU may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Polls and Surveys.</strong> From time to time, we may conduct polls and surveys. Information collected through our polls, surveys, and questionnaires is used in the aggregate, unless we contact you to request permission to use your individual responses for a particular purpose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
	
	
<h3>Uses of Personal Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The personal information that SEIU collects on the Website helps us, our state and local affiliates and SEIU-related organizations to efficiently and effectively represent our members, to pursue our advocacy agenda, and to provide valuable member benefits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to advance these goals and activities, we may share the personal information that we collect about you with our state and local affiliates and other SEIU-related organizations, as well as third parties that perform services on our behalf. Additionally, subject to applicable law, we may share any of the personal information that we collect about you with certain third parties that share our interests. We will not share any financial information you have entered into this website unless legally required to do so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will use your email address to communicate with you about SEIU's activities and offerings, unless you opt-out from receiving such messages. We will also use your email address for administrative purposes, such as notifying you of major Website changes, sending messages related to actions you have taken on the site or for customer service purposes. Although we hope you'll find these communications informative and useful, if you don't, you can always unsubscribe by following the simple instructions included in each email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We use both your personally identifying information and certain non-personally-identifying information (such as anonymous usage data, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality of your user experience and the design of the Website and to create new features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user behavior, preferences, trends, and actions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
	
	
<h3>Other Disclosures</h3>
<p>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. If we receive a subpoena requesting information about you and if you have provided us with your email address, we will attempt to notify you of the subpoena at the email address that you have provided. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Website or using the SEIU name, to prevent bodily harm, to enforce our User Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, our members, the public or SEIU. In the unlikely event that SEIU (or substantially all of its assets) is merged with another entity, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. Furthermore, SEIU may offer the ability for users to connect with the Website using a mobile device, either through a mobile application or via a mobile optimized website. The provisions of this Privacy Policy apply to all such mobile access and use of mobile devices. When you download or use our mobile applications, or access one of our mobile optimized sites, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable location services in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or the manufacture of your particular device.</p>
	
	
<h3>Information Security and Data Integrity</h3>
<p>SEIU takes security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>Our Website may also permit you to access non-SEIU sites. It is important to remember that, if you link to a non-SEIU site from our Website, that party's privacy policy and its user agreement apply to you. We encourage you to learn about each third party's privacy policy before giving personal information to them.</p>
<p>SEIU reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on this page, so we encourage you to check this page regularly. Your continued use of this Website following any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the Website, or your account, please feel free to contact us</p>

  <li>
    <p>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are, or are authorized to act on behalf of, the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>

	<li><h4>Warranty Disclaimer</h4>
	
<p>This website is provided to you "as is." You agree that your use of the SEIU website shall be at your sole risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, SEIU, as well as its officers, directors, employees, and agents (collectively, the "SEIU parties"), disclaim all warranties, express or implied, in connection with the website and your use thereof. The SEIU parties cannot and do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, currentness, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose of the site's content or the content of any sites linked to this site. Nor do the SEIU parties guarantee that the website will be error free, or continuously available, or that the website will be free of viruses or other harmful components. The SEIU parties do not warrant, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or services provided, advertised or offered by a third party through the SEIU website or any hyperlinked website or featured in any banner or other advertising.</p>
	
	</li>
	
	<li><h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
	
	
<p>In no event shall the SEIU parties be liable to you or anyone else for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages whatsoever, whether or not they are foreseeable, relating to this website, including any damages resulting from any (I) errors, mistakes or inaccuracies of content, (II) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to and use of our website, (III) unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information and/or financial information stored therein, (IV) interruption or cessation of transmission to or from our website, (V) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like, which may be transmitted to or through our website by any third party, and/or (VI) errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of your use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the SEIU website, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, and whether or not SEIU is advised of the possibility of such damages. You specifically acknowledge that the SEIU parties shall not be liable for user content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party and that the risk of harm or damage from the foregoing rests entirely with you. Certain state laws do not allow limitations on or implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. To the extent these laws apply to you, some of the provisions set forth in this agreement may not apply. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the SEIU parties against any and all claims, of whatever nature, that arise out of your use of and access to the SEIU website or your violation of any of this user agreement. This indemnification obligation will survive this user agreement and your use of the SEIU website.</p>
	
	</li>
	
	<li><h4>Ability to Accept User Agreement</h4>
	
		<p>You affirm that you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in this User Agreement, and to abide by and comply with this User Agreement. In any case, you affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the SEIU Website is not intended for children under 13.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
	
	
	
<p>This User Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of Washington, D.C., without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and SEIU that arises in whole or in part from the Website shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Washington, D.C. This User Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by SEIU on the Website, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and SEIU concerning the Website and supersedes prior agreements, if any, between you and SEIU relating to any matter dealt with in the User Agreement. If any provision of this User Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this User Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this User Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and SEIU's failure to assert any right or provision under this User Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. This User Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by SEIU without restriction. This User Agreement and the rights and obligations created hereunder shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefits of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or should be construed to confer upon any other person any right, remedy or claim under or by virtue of this Agreement.</p>
	
<p>You and SEIU agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Website must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
