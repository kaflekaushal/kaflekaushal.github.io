<h3><strong>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</strong></h3>



<p>We collect information you provide directly to our campaign or via ActBlue, which processes our campaign donations.  For example, we collect information when you sign up to receive updates, request information, fill out a form, sign a petition, sign up as a volunteer or for an event, create an account, participate in a contest or promotion, make a donation or purchase, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request support, send us an email, or otherwise communicate with us.  The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number, credit card and other payment information (although payment information is generally collected directly by a third-party processor), and any other information you choose to provide.</p>



<p>In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may require us to collect certain personal information from donors.&nbsp; For example, the FEC requires us to collect (and disclose to them) the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of all individuals whose donations to the Campaign exceed $200 per election cycle.</p>
