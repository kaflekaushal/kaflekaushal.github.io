			<p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the official web site of Greg For Montana.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for collection, use and disclosure of your information that you provide to us when you use the Site. By using this Site, you agree that your use of the Site is governed by this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically check this Site for updates. Your continued use of the Site affirms your agreement to any changes we make to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note the distinction between our privacy practices in connection with your visit to the Site, and our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected and How It Is Collected</strong></p>
<p>Voluntary Information: We may collect personal information you voluntarily provide to us including, but not limited to your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, mobile number and geographic location. You may provide this information when you request information, register, make a purchase or for other purposes. We may also collect demographic information such as gender, date of birth, occupation, employer name and zip code. In limited circumstances, we may collect payment information such as credit card number where needed to complete a requested service or transaction.</p>
<p>By requesting information to your mobile phone, we may obtain the following information from you in connection with our SMS service: your cell phone number, your carrier’s name and the date, time and content of your messages, as well as other information that you provide. We will use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Automatically Generated Information: We may also collect non-personally identifiable information that is generated automatically while you are visiting the Site or elsewhere on the Internet when our advertisements are served, also known as log files. This data includes, but is not limited to, information such as IP address, web pages visited before and after visiting the Site, date and time, domain type, type of mobile device you use, your device’s unique ID, web pages you view and links you click on within the Site and interactions with our advertisements delivered by us or advertisements delivered by a third party advertising technology vendor. This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and pixels. An IP address, for example, is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit the Site, we may view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical location of the device and understand from what regions of the world the Site visitors come. We also may use your non-personally identifiable information to enhance the Site.</p>
<p>All Site users remain anonymous unless they choose to give us their personal information. You may elect not to allow us to collect and use this non-personally identifiable data as part of our Service by following the Opt Out procedures described below.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Other Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Overview: We may use cookies and other technologies to obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses the Site or visits a web site in our network. ‘Cookies’ are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser.

Rejecting or removing browser or flash cookies may affect certain features of our Sites.</p>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the site, which uses cookies.</p>
<p>Cookies are used to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of the website and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Greg For Montana.</p>
<p>Google Analytics collects information anonymously. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. Neither Greg For Montana nor Google will link, or seek to link, an IP address with the identity of a computer user.

You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit the Site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page.</p>
<p>We may use other companies to set cookies on the Site and advertisements and gather cookie information for us. In some cases, we may also use another company to operate web servers or process credit card purchases for the Site. The Site may use cookies and other technology to speed navigation and keep track of items and to gather anonymous traffic data that we may use to enhance the Site, our Services, marketing and other internal purposes. If you create an account to log on to the Site, Greg For Montana will set a persistent cookie to store your username and password so that you do not have to enter it more than once.
